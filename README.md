# Project - Web Programming with Ruby

Over the next week you will build an app to consolidate and expand on everything you have learned:

* Object oriented programming with Ruby
* Test Driven Development
* Web Programming (REST, MVC)
* Interacting with a PostgreSQL database (CRUD)

## Rules

The project must be built using only:

* HTML / CSS
* Ruby
* Sinatra
* PostgreSQL and the PG gem

It must **NOT** use:

* Any Object Relational Mapper (e.g. ActiveRecord)
* JavaScript. At all. Don't even think about it.
* Any pre-built CSS libraries, such as Bootstrap.
* Authentication. Assume that the user already has secure access to the app.

## Sports Scoring app

Build an app that lets a sports fan keep track of their favourite sports league.

As a huge fan of [your sport], you want to stay up to date with the league. You're interested to see which team leads the table and who won the latest games/matches/fixtures/bouts/â€¦

### MVP:
* The app should allow the user to create, edit and delete teams to the league
* The user should be able to create, edit and delete games
* There should be a way to display all the games for a team and all the teams involved in a game
* The app should display if a game was won or lost

### Possible Extensions:
* Create a league table to see who is on top of the league
* Add players to teams and let them have game stats (points won, fouls, etc.)
* Anything else you can think of
